      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;white-belt-really&#34;&gt;White Belt? Really?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yeah I know how it must sound, after all a white belt is the lowest rank you can get in martial arts. It is only natural people will see the title and think &amp;ldquo;this guy is probably a little slow, why would he be advertising himself as a beginner?&amp;rdquo; As a hacker name especially it probably sounds extra silly, so many people have cool names about hacking and zero days and all sorts of awesome hacks. The thing is, what I call myself is not what I want others to call me, it&amp;rsquo;s what I want to call myself. I do want to be a beginner, this is how I feel as a practitioner of actual martial arts for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
